Hi,  
This is Nam Gyu Lee from South Korea (Republic of Korea) :kr:

I am a student pursuing my undergraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence with a minor in Applied Mathematics at [Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT)](https://www.iit.edu/).

I am profoundly captivated by the immense possibilities of artificial intelligence and am especially drawn to the role of an artificial intelligence platform engineer, inspired by a recent interview with NVIDIA's founder, Jensen Huang. My aim is to empower individuals to develop their own artificial intelligence solutions without the prerequisite of mastering programming languages.

My goal is to positively impact society through innovative technologies. Through various projects and learning experiences related to artificial intelligence, I have been building my skills and aim to contribute to solving real-world problems.

I have interests in diverse fields of artificial intelligence such as data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing, and I am challenging myself to become an expert in these areas to lead global technological innovations.

I have an unwavering passion for new technologies and possess strong problem-solving abilities. I also enjoy collaborating with team members to achieve common goals. I am seeking opportunities to leverage my abilities as an artificial intelligence platform engineer, explore new technologies, and continue to grow.
