In this case, a measure of how sensitive the solution to a linear equation is to the data changes or changes to the matrix itself.</li> </ul> <p>Condition numbers are, thus, important to understand in machine learning because they make our models unstable and, even worse, very sensitive and bad, in cases of using a regression training algorithm for our linear models.</p> <p>This means that a small perturbation or error may cause significant changes in the output for the same inputs. This is especially alarming in machine learning, which develops models using noisy or incomplete data. Model predictions can be negatively impacted by high sensitivity and may yield unreliable results.</p> <p>The condition number is not only significant for solution precision, but it is also paramount for the generalization of machine learning algorithms. Dress a matrix in a condition number that means that it is well conditioned, and you can have a much smoother landscape with a better optimization convergence during training and have models that generalize effectively to unseen data. On the other hand, under-conditioned models are likely to overfit the training data, which is a characteristic of lower generalization ability.</p> <h3 id="citation">Citation</h3> <ul> <li>Guggenheimer, H., Edelman, A., \&amp; Johnson, C.

When do you need to use regularization? Would you use LASSO or Ridge in a high-dimensional problem? Which is generally more accurate? Why?</h2> <p>LASSO: A regression analysis method that enhances the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the resulting statistical model by performing both variable selection and regularization. Lasso penalizes based on the absolute value of the coefficients. It not only shrinks the coefficient but also some can be set to exactly zero, making it a variable selection technique.</p> <p>Ridge regularization: Adds a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. In this case, use an L2 norm of the coefficients, which shrinks all coefficients towards zero, but does not eliminate them. Additionally, Rdge performs better when the multicollinearity among the predictors is present.</p> <p>Using regularization is useful for high-dimensional datasets since it curbs excessive fitting of those datasets.</p> <p>I would use Lasso. It is also common practice to use Lasso in some cases due to its variable selection ability. It can shrink the model incrementally and eventually force some coefficients to be exactly zero. This could make the model simpler and more interpretable, possibly enhancing its performance in the presence of new data. However, Ridge, most of the time, incorporates all predictors, which might not be suitable in a situation when one is trying to build a prediction from the most crucial features.</p> <p>In essence, Ridge estimates tend to be better when there is high multicollinearity while all the features of the data are of interest because it yields more stable estimates in this case. To handle this concern, Ridge reduces the size of the coefficients and retains all the features thereby increasing the robustness of the analysis and the results.</p> <h3 id="citation-1">Citation</h3> <p>-Ranstam, J., Cook, J.A.

Why is it used so widely in Deep Learning?</h2> <ul> <li>To address overfitting, Dropout randomly sets a subset of neurons to zero at the start of each training cycle. This procedure increases robustness by preventing complex co-adaptations and forcing the network to learn redundant representations. Dropout, by its nature, makes the network less sensitive to individual neurons. As a result, this model can generalize and perform better on new, untested data. A more generalized representation that can manage different inputs is achieved using dropout, allowing each model update to be viewed as a mini-semble of multiple neural network topologies. It is also shown to improve performance on a wide range of tasks and datasets. Finally, it helps the model perform better and train faster. During training, it allows models to learn more efficiently and reach their best performance quicker by temporarily turning off some neurons during training.</li> </ul> <h3 id="citation-3">Citation</h3> <ul> <li>Byrd, J., \&amp; Lipton, Z. C. (2018). What is the Effect of Importance Weighting in Deep Learning?

First, it is utilized for an explicit feature extraction, which is localized in a region of interest. Such features are derived from local areas of the image, which enables the identification of edges, textures, and other low-level patterns. Second, these local features help in enhancing the correlation as well as the intensity of pixels from areas that are closer as opposed to those that are farther away. It is important to mention that during the image classification process, cure areas are concentrated, which makes local features even more significant.</li> </ul> <p>Second, it is utilized for the purpose of architecture that is economical. For instance, architecture that has been designed with weight sharing in mind for a structure such as a neural network can apply the same filters or kernels all over the entire image, thus minimizing the number of parameters, as well as the number of computations required to be performed. Such relevant units in the feature maps process little portions at a time while interrelating and distinguishing a pattern.</p> <p>Third, it is utilized for the hierarchical feature processing. Convolutional networks build hierarchical representations, starting with simple features and progressing to more complex patterns. In the same way, the local features detect some parts, which in the next stage get combined for general feature detection. Moreover, deep representations are less affected than shallow representations by transformations like translations, scaling, and small rotation of the images.</p> <p>Fourth, it is used in the context of invariance. Convolutional layers give consistent regions as patterns that can be recognized. Such patterns can also be enhanced through data augmentation or more sophisticated architectures to be invariant to scaling or rotations.</p> <p>Fifth, it is used for efficient learning of features and structures of patterns as well as deeper networks. Convolutional networks make use of local receptive fields, weight sharing, and subsampling to hit efficiently, and with so many processes, the image across features. Earlier networks with no invariances had average higher misclassification rates of around 4.5\%, but these architecture limitations have largely been alleviated by complementary ones other architectures have strengthened.</p> <p>Lastly, emphasizes other methods as wavelet transforms. In some of the tasks, wavelet transforms are used in conjunction with CNNs in order to increase edge detection and capture discrete jumps in images, although CNNs are now robust enough to perform such tasks independently.</p> <h2 id="citation-4">Citation</h2> <ul> <li>Bishop, C.

Why are these factors relevant?</h2> <ul> <li>There are several factors to consider in determining which model is the better. First, model Complexity and interpretability. If the model is too complicated, then the risk of overfitting increases. The complex model has good performance in the train data, but it might not perform well in the new data. Also, too complex a model is hard to interpret, and there are possible debugging difficulties. The simple model makes it easy to understand the result or the processing of the prediction.</li> </ul> <p>Second, robustness to overfitting. If the model is overfitting to the training data, it does not generalize well to the new data. In particular, if the training data is low or noisy, the model is likely to overfit. Especially with less training data or too much noise, there is the possibility to be overfitting.</p> <p>Lastly, training time and resource efficiency. A more complicated model takes more time to train, and the time required to train models can increase exponentially, especially when trained on a large dataset. Also, a complex model such as a deep learning model can require significant computational resources.</p> <h3 id="citation-5">Citation</h3> <ul> <li>Bishop, C. M. (2006).
