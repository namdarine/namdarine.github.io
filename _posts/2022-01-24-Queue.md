# Queue

> This post was written based on what I've learn in college class and the materials I looked for. Also, it was written to study while reviewing, so there may be insufficient or wrong information. If there's anything to fix, please leave a comment!

A queue is an example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection. Queues are common in computer programs, where they are implemented as data structures coupled with access routines, as an abstract data structure or in object-oriented languages as classes.

## Definition of Queue

> A line or sequence of people or vehicles awaiting their turn to be attended to or to proceed.

A collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.
A structure in which elements are added to the rear and removed from the front; a "First in, First out" (FIFO) structure.

### Real-life example of queue

One of the real-life example of queue is that getting in the line to order in McDonald's. The person who comes earlier through the door orders first and leave the line. The other people who come next order next and leave the line. In this situation, the door of this store is the entry(rear) of the queue, the line is the queue, and the other end that people leave after order is the exit(front) of the queue.
Simply we usually call it "First come, First serve".

<div class="row mt-3">
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

</div>
</div>

## Difference between Stack and Queue

In a stack we remove the element the **most recently added**. In a queue, we remove the element the **least recently added**.

## Operation on Queue

<div class="row mt-3">
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Queue_operation.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
</div>

Constructor

- new: creates an empty queue

  ```java
  public ArrayQueue () {
      elements = (T[]) new Object[defCap];
      rear = defCap - 1;
  }

  public ArrayQueue(int max) {
      elements = (T[]) new Object[max];
      rear = max - 1;
  }
  ```

Transformers

- enqueue: **Adds** an element to the rear of a queue. If the queue is full, throws the overflow exception. Similar with 'push()' in stack, but the difference is that 'push()' is added to the front of the stack.

  ```java
  @Override
  public void enqueue(T element) throws QueueOverflowException {
      if (isFull())   // Throws 'QueueOverflowException' if this queue is FULL.
          throw new QueueOverflowException("Enqueue attempted on a full queue.");

      else {  // Adds element to the rear of this queue and adds 1 to 'num' variable.
          rear = (rear + 1) % elements.length;
          elements[rear] = element;
          num = num + 1;
      }
  }
  ```

- dequeue: **Removes** an element from the front of the queue. The elements are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, throws the underflow exception. Similar with the 'pop()' in stack.

  ```java
  @Override
  public T dequeue() throws QueueUnderflowException {
      if (isEmpty())  // Throws 'QueueUnderflowException' if this queue is EMPTY.
          throw new QueueUnderflowException("Dequeue attempted on a empty queue.");

      else {
          /* Removes front element of this queue and returns it.
           * And removes 1 from 'num' variable.
           */
          T toReturn = elements[front];
          elements[front] = null;
          front = (front + 1) % element.length;
          num = num - 1;
          return toReturn;
      }
  }
  ```

Observers
They have no effect on the queue.

- front: Get the front element from queue.

  ```java
  public Object front() {     // Returns the front index of this queue.
      return elements[front];
  }
  ```

- rear: get the last item from queue.

  ```java
  public Object rear() {      // Returns the rear index of this queue.
      return elements[rear];
  }
  ```

### Full code (Floating Front Queue)

```java
public class ArrayQueue<T> implements QueueInterface<T> {
    protected final int defCap = 50;    // Set the size of this Queue's capacity
    protected T[] elements;             // Holds queue elements
    protected int num = 0;              // Number of elements in this queue
    protected int front = 0;            // Index of front of this queue
    protected int rear;                 // Index of rear of this queue

    // Constructor
    public ArrayQueue () {
        elements = (T[]) new Object[defCap];
        rear = defCap - 1;
    }

    public ArrayQueue(int max) {
        elements = (T[]) new Object[max];
        rear = max - 1;
    }

    // Transformers
    @Override
    public void enqueue(T element) throws QueueOverflowException {
        if (isFull())   // Throws 'QueueOverflowException' if this queue is FULL.
            throw new QueueOverflowException("Enqueue attempted on a full queue.");

        else {  // Adds element to the rear of this queue and adds 1 to 'num' variable.
            rear = (rear + 1) % elements.length;
            elements[rear] = element;
            num = num + 1;
        }
    }

    @Override
    public T dequeue() throws QueueUnderflowException {
        if (isEmpty())  // Throws 'QueueUnderflowException' if this queue is EMPTY.
            throw new QueueUnderflowException("Dequeue attempted on a empty queue.");

        else {
            /* Removes front element of this queue and returns it.
             * And removes 1 from 'num' variable.
             */
            T toReturn = elements[front];
            elements[front] = null;
            front = (front + 1) % element.length;
            num = num - 1;
            return toReturn;
        }
    }

    // Observers
    @Override
    public boolean isFull() {
        // Returns true if this queue is FULL. If not, returns false.
        return num == elements.length;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isEmpty() {
        // Returns true if this queue is empty. If not, returns false.
        return num == 0;
    }

    @Override
    public int size() {
        // Returns the number of the elements in this queue.
        return num;
    }

    public Object front() {     // Returns the front index of this queue.
        return elements[front];
    }

    public Object rear() {      // Returns the rear index of this queue.
        return elements[rear];
    }

    public void dump() throws QueueUnderflowException {
        if (isEmpty())
            throw new QueueUnderflowException("Dequeue attempted on empty queue");

        else {
            for (int i = 0; i < num; i++)
                System.out.print(elements[(i + front) % elements.length] + " ");
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Full code with Fixed Front Queue

```java
public class FixedFrontQueue<T> implements QueueInterface<T> {
    protected final int defCap = 40;
    protected T[] elements;
    protected int num = 0;
    protected int front = 0;
    protected int rear;

    // Constructor
    public FixedFrontQueue() {
        elements = (T[]) new Object[defCap];
        rear = defCap - 1;
    }

    public FixedFrontQueue (int max) {
        elements = (T[]) new Object[max];
        rear = max - 1;
    }

    // Transformers
    public void enqueue (T element) throws QueueOverflowException {
        if (isFull())   // Throws 'QueueOverflowException' if this queue is FULL.
            throw new QueueOverflowException ("Enqueue attempted on a full queue");

        else {  // Adds new element to the rear of this queue. And adds 1 to 'num' variable.
            rear = (rear + 1) % elements.length;
            elements[rear] = element;
            num = num + 1;
        }
    }

    public T dequeue() throws QueueUnderflowException {
        if (isEmpty())  // Throws 'QueueUnderflowException' if this queue is EMPTY.
            throw new QueueUnderflowException("Dequeue attempted on empty queue");

        else {
            /* Removes the front element and returns it.
             * After remove, moves the rest of element to forward, and reduces 1 from 'num' variable.
             */

            T toReturn = elements[front];
            elements[front] = elements[front + 1];
            for (int i = 0; i <= num; i++) {    // Move elements (which are in this queue. Not array's name) to forward.
                elements[i] = elements[i + 1];
            }
            rear = (rear - 1) % elements.length;
            num = num - 1;

            return toReturn;
        }
    }

    // Observers
    public Object front() {     // Returns the front index of this queue.
        return front;
    }

    public Object rear() {      // Returns the rear index of this queue.
        return rear;
    }

    public Object frontEle() {  // Returns the front element of this queue.
        return elements[front];
    }

    public Object rearEle() {   // Returns the rear element of this queue.
        return elements[rear];
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {  // Returns true if this queue is empty. If not, returns false.
        return num == 0;
    }

    public boolean isFull() {   // Returns true if this queue is full. If not, returns false.
        return num = elements.length;
    }

    public int size() {     // Returns the number of the elements in this queue.
        return num;
    }

    public void dump() throws QueueUnderflowException {     // Print all elements in this queue.
        if (isEmpty())
            throw new QueueUnderflowException("Dequeue attempted on empty queue");

        else {
            for (int i = 0; i < num; i++)
                System.out.print(elements[(i + front) % elements.length] + " ");
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage of Queue

- Operating systems often maintain a queue of processes that are ready to execute or that are waiting for a particular event to occur.
- Computer systems must often provide a "holding area" for messages between two processes, two programs, or even two systems. This holding area is usually called a "buffer" and is often implemented as a queue.
- When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Such as CPU scheduling, disk Scheduling.
- When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes.Such as IO Buffers, pipes, file IO.

## Complexity of Queue (Big-O)

enqueue, dequeue, front, and rear are O(1).

## Implementation of Queue

Array-based, Linked-based.

### Comparing Queue implementations

#### Storage size

- Array-based: takes the same amount of memory, no matter how many array slots are actually used, proportional to current capacity.
- Link-based: takes space proportional to actual size of the queue. But each element requires more space than array-based.

#### Operation efficiency

All operations are O(1), except for the constructors

- Array-based: O(N)
- Linked-based: O(1)
