      description: "Individual Project| May 2024 - Present"
      details:
        - "Developing a scalable Machine Learning Platform as a Service web app that allows users to upload datasets for clustering or classification. The system uses AWS for distributed processing."
        - "Developing proficiency in containerizing applications and managing cloud resources, focusing on automating machine learning workflows for scalable web applications."
        - "Technologies Used: AWS, Python, Flask, pySpark, Docker"

    - title: <a href="https://github.com/namdarine/TIF_Chicago_Project">Chicago TIF Analysis</a>
      year: 2024
      description: "Illinois Tech | Jan 2024 - Apr 2024"
      details:
        - "Collaborated with a team of 5 to analyze the correlation between income, education, and TIF districts in Chicago, uncovering potential inequalities linked to TIFs and their socioeconomic impact on various racial demographics."
        -	"Led data extraction and filtering to ensure clean, relevant data for analysis aligned with the project requirements, enhancing overall project accuracy and reliability."
        -	"This role improved my knowledge of data processing and critical analysis, deepening my understanding of data’s role in highlighting social and economic disparities."
        - Results: Found a 50% income gap between predominantly white ($76K) and non-white ($38K) TIF districts, indicating potential biases in fund allocation.
        - Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, GeoJSON, k-Means Clustering
